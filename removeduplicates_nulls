Problem Statement:

How many calls that were tagged 'false call / false alarm' were treated as highest priority and how many were treated as any other priority?

Steps:
  1. Read the dataset in dataFrames (Remove duplicates (incident numbers) and null rows)
  2. From df_fire_incidents filter all records where 'Primary situation' column has 'False' as a substring
  3. From df_fire_calls filter all records where 'OrigPriority' is 3.
  4. Join the resultant columns and get a count
  

fire_incidents = '/databricks-datasets/learning-spark-v2/sf-fire/sf-fire-incidents.csv"
fire_calls = '/databricks-datasets/learning-spark-v2/sf-fire/sf-fire-calls.csv"

import pyspark.sql.functions as f
df_fire_incidents = spark.read\
  .format("csv")\
  .option("header", True)\
  .option("inferSchema, True)\
  .load(fire_incidents)\
  .filter(f.col('Incident Number').isNotNull())\
  .dropDuplicates(subset = ['Incident Number']
  
df_fire_incidents.cache()
